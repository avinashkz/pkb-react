In his writings he first dealt with Kerala history in the anthology \u2018Narayana Guru\u2019, the great social reformer of Kerala who changed the face of its caste ridden society. To fully comprehend the greatness of the man and the work he did, the history of Kerala in the 18th and 19th centuries are studied as a back drop. He brushes with Kerala history again to study why Tipu Sultan, an able ruler and administrator is only perceived as an aggressor and religious fanatic in our writings. The culmination of these studies over 3 decades was his work on the social history \u2018Jaathivyavasthayum Kerala Charitravum\u2019 (The Caste System and History of Kerala). The book created a furor in the \u2018historical circles\u2019 and generated widespread interest and discussion on Kerala history. The unrealistic and imaginative flourishes that were passed off as history were debunked with this single work.
