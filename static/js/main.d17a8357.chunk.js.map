The book also amply demonstrates the intellectual depth and vast understanding that Balakrishanan who would have been hardly 23 years at the time had. Most of Balakrishnan’s works are critical works. His studies on Chandu Menon (the first widely accepted Malayali novelist), the art of poetry through Kumaran Asan (the doyen of Malayalam literature) Vyasa Bharatha & Ezhuthachan (the father of Malayalam poetry) and the art of the novel are unparallel works that enriched critical literature.\"}</Text>\n\t\t\t<Text>{\"An avid reader, history was his favourite. As part of his wide reading, Kerala history naturally found a special place. He found that there was a disconnect between what the existing popular history sought to project, and what he saw of Kerala from the old literature, travelogues, and other first hand sources that is used to study history. In his writings he first dealt with Kerala history in the anthology ‘Narayana Guru’, the great social reformer of Kerala who changed the face of its caste ridden society. To fully comprehend the greatness of the man and the work he did, the history of Kerala in the 18th and 19th centuries are studied as a back drop. He brushes with Kerala history again to study why Tipu Sultan, an able ruler and administrator is only perceived as an aggressor and religious fanatic in our writings. The culmination of these studies over 3 decades was his work on the social history ‘Jaathivyavasthayum Kerala Charitravum’ (The Caste System and History of Kerala). The book created a furor in the ‘historical circles’ and generated widespread interest and discussion on Kerala history. The unrealistic and imaginative flourishes that were passed off as history were debunked with this single work. The people and their history were studied within the reality frame work of the caste system, agriculture, commerce, administrative set up etc. It is a seminal work that deals with various aspects of Kerala’s history including the development of the Malayalam language. \"}</Text>\n\t\t\t<Text>{\"However what catapulted him as a popular writer was his second novel ‘Ini Njan Urangatte’ (And Now Let Me Sleep).

It maintains the original story, epic atmosphere, events and characters which distinguishes it from other works based on Mahabharatha The book is unparalleled in its lofty language, imagery and depth and is considered one of the best classics in Indian Literature. English, Tamil and Kannada translations of this novel have been brought out by Kendra Sahitya Akademi.

Though serious studies have been conducted, no one has dealt with how a &apos;translator&apos; of Mahabharath becomes the foremost poet and father of Malayalam literature.

The story and event sequence with their relative importance in the original is totally rejected by Ezhuthachan. The first nine chapters of the book deal with this vital distinction. This is followed by a chapter on Adhyatma Ramayanam. The next four chapters deal with the peculiarities of the artistic genius of Ezhuthachan.

The credit for this book goes to Poorna Printing & Publishing house, Varkala and Dr S Shaji. Of the compilation of 25 articles, 20 are related to history.  The evolution of the caste sytem in India, the fatal blow the British rule dealt to it and the skewed manifestations of the attempts to tilt back the clock come up repeatedly in many of these essays.  Our failure to appreciate the depths to which caste influences our thinking denies the ability to confront reality and to come out of its clutches.  What started as social reform movements is soon overshadowed by regressive counter-movements that seek to fight the forces that strike at the roots of the injustices of the cast system.  It is a tragedy that we are unable to distinguish in our freedom struggle these forces from the aspiration and confidence of a new thinking striving for self-determination.
