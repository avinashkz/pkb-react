His oratorical skills developed during this period. He was actively encouraged by his teachers. The headmaster K.C.Abraham or Abraham master (who later served as governor of Andhra Pradesh) and Alexander, the Malayalam teacher were tutors here with whom he maintained contacts and whom he remembered with great respect.

The involvement in quit India movement ended in jail.

But practically little of what he wrote has survived. His recorded journey as an author starts from the anthology ‘Narayana ‘Guru’, a comprehensive work on the great reformer and spiritual leader of Kerala. The book also amply demonstrates the intellectual depth and vast understanding that Balakrishanan who would have been hardly 23 years at the time had. Most of Balakrishnan’s works are critical works. His studies on Chandu Menon (the first widely accepted Malayali novelist), the art of poetry through Kumaran Asan (the doyen of Malayalam literature) Vyasa Bharatha & Ezhuthachan (the father of Malayalam poetry) and the art of the novel are unparallel works that enriched critical literature.\"}</Text>\n\t\t\t<Text>{\"An avid reader, history was his favourite. As part of his wide reading, Kerala history naturally found a special place. He found that there was a disconnect between what the existing popular history sought to project, and what he saw of Kerala from the old literature, travelogues, and other first hand sources that is used to study history. In his writings he first dealt with Kerala history in the anthology ‘Narayana Guru’, the great social reformer of Kerala who changed the face of its caste ridden society. To fully comprehend the greatness of the man and the work he did, the history of Kerala in the 18th and 19th centuries are studied as a back drop. He brushes with Kerala history again to study why Tipu Sultan, an able ruler and administrator is only perceived as an aggressor and religious fanatic in our writings. The culmination of these studies over 3 decades was his work on the social history ‘Jaathivyavasthayum Kerala Charitravum’ (The Caste System and History of Kerala). The book created a furor in the ‘historical circles’ and generated widespread interest and discussion on Kerala history. The unrealistic and imaginative flourishes that were passed off as history were debunked with this single work. The people and their history were studied within the reality frame work of the caste system, agriculture, commerce, administrative set up etc. It is a seminal work that deals with various aspects of Kerala’s history including the development of the Malayalam language. \"}</Text>\n\t\t\t<Text>{\"However what catapulted him as a popular writer was his second novel ‘Ini Njan Urangatte’ (And Now Let Me Sleep).

It maintains the original story, epic atmosphere, events and characters which distinguishes it from other works based on Mahabharatha The book is unparalleled in its lofty language, imagery and depth and is considered one of the best classics in Indian Literature. English, Tamil and Kannada translations of this novel have been brought out by Kendra Sahitya Akademi. The novel won him the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award, Sahitya Pravarthaka Benefit Fund Award and the prestigious Vayalar Award given in honour of the poet Vayalar Rama Varma,who was immortalised in Malayalam cinema by his beautiful lyrics.\"}</Text>\n\t\t\t<Text>{\"‘Ini Njan Urangatte’ was quite a departure from his first novel ‘Pluto’ the story of his dog.

So, many of these were lost after their first publication. Some of these were complied and published in his life time ‘Mayatha Sandhyakal’ (Unfading Twilights) and ‘Nidra Sancharangal’ (Sleep Walkings). These were combined and brought out as Balakrishnante Lekhanangal (Articles of Balakrishnan) in 2005. A subsequent collection of articles were published as ‘Keraleeyathayum Mattum’ (The Essence of Kerala etc) and Veritta Chintakal (Thoughts Apart).

The net result of all this was a ruined academic future. He put to full use his capabilities as an orator and writer during this period of political activity. He was the force behind the weekly 'Azad', the mouthpiece of the student Congress started in 1947. Later he edited the weekly of the Kerala Socialist party - 'Socialist'.

It changes form in hands of each\n        genius. To reduce the specialities of novel as an art form to a\n        prescriptive code will be a mistake.

The credit for this book goes to Poorna\n        Printing & Publishing house, Varkala and Dr S Shaji. Of the compilation\n        of 25 articles, 20 are related to history. The evolution of the caste\n        sytem in India, the fatal blow the British rule dealt to it and the\n        skewed manifestations of the attempts to tilt back the clock come up\n        repeatedly in many of these essays. Our failure to appreciate the depths\n        to which caste influences our thinking denies the ability to confront\n        reality and to come out of its clutches. What started as social reform\n        movements is soon overshadowed by regressive counter-movements that seek\n        to fight the forces that strike at the roots of the injustices of the\n        cast system. It is a tragedy that we are unable to distinguish in our\n        freedom struggle these forces from the aspiration and confidence of a\n        new thinking striving for self-determination.
