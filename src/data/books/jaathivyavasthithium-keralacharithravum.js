			<h1>JAATHIVYAVASTHITIUM KERALA CHARITHRAVUM</h1>
			<p>This history book of P K Balakrishnan titled Jaathivyavasthitium Kerala Charitravum deals with the social history of Kerala from the point of evolution of its agricultural villages. It deals separately with the birth of the agrarian economic structure, caste, royalty, ownership, language etc. 1850-1890 is an important period in the social history of Kerala when substantial changes began in the caste society of Kerala. The book ends at the beginning of thisperiod.History was never the same after it was first published in 1983. It was a marked departure from the prevailing history and examined the history afresh on the basis of first hand evidence - the geographic evolution of land area, its resources, accounts of foreign travellers etc. The land and resources and its exploitation hardly supported the glowing past the earlier historians had built.</p>
			<p>In approach to methodology, the book follows that of D.D.Kosambi. Balakrishnan hopes that this book will lead to a comprehensive discussion of Kerala history considering all the circumstances and sans caste prejudice and egos.</p>

	overview: "A book on the social history of Kerala starting from the point of evolution of its agricultural villages up to1850-1890, the period when substantial changes began in the caste society. Examining history afresh on the basis of the geographic evolution of land area, resources, accounts of foreign travellers etc it reaches the unavoidable conclusion that the land, resources and its exploitation hardly supported the glowing past the earlier historians had built. It is a seminal work that deals with various aspects of Keralaâ€™s history including the development of the Malayalam language.",
