	subtitle: "The Caste system and History of Kerala (1983)",
	overview: "A book on the social history of Kerala starting from the point of evolution of its agricultural villages up to1850-1890, the period when substantial changes began in the caste society. Examining history afresh on the basis of the geographic evolution of land area, resources, accounts of foreign travellers etc it reaches the unavoidable conclusion that the land, resources and its exploitation hardly supported the glowing past the earlier historians had built. It is a seminal work that deals with various aspects of Keralaâ€™s history including the development of the Malayalam language.",
