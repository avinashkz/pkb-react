      <h1>NARAYANAGURU</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Narayana Guru written and compiled by P K Balakrishnan is an exceptional
        work on the great social reformer of Kerala and spiritual leader Sri.
        Narayana Guru published on the event of his birth centenary. It gives a
        rare insight into the person that he was and the activities of the
        visionary. The book is carefully crafted with a selection of essays by
        many eminent personalities and essays written by Balakrishnan himself.
        The essays are classified into eight parts as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dark Background and Some Resplendent Documents:</li>
        <p>
          This section contains 38 documents consisting of articles by prominent
          personalities, proclamations, extracts from other documents etc.
          Greatness cannot be de-linked from space and time. Seen in this
          context, a life history not linked to a historical background will be
          incomplete. Swami&apos;s activities and the ascendancy of Ezhavas ( A
          hindu community of kerala) are interlinked. The effort in this section
          is to give a brief of the historical background necessary for this
          study.
        </p>

        <li>A Life Changed Without Knowing Challenge:</li>
        <p>
          It is not the intention of the book to chronologically describe the
          life of the saint. Depending on the interest and ability of the reader
          a concept of the saint will get imprinted in their minds from the
          book. This section also contains the brief anecdotes/ sayings of the
          Sri Narayana Guru.
        </p>

        <li>The Mirror of Memories:</li>
        <p>
          This section contains seven commemorative articles by people who were
          closely associated with Narayana Guru.
        </p>

        <li>Biographical Setting:</li>
        <p>
          These are articles by Balakrishnan himself on the life of seven of
          Gurudev&apos;s disciples who were versatile in nature and beliefs and
          yet worked together without compromising their beliefs. And that
          ability to work together getting beyond their inherent contradictions
          is Narayana Guru.
        </p>

        <li>The Poetry of Vision and the Poet&apos;s Vision:</li>
        <p>
          This section intents to give a picture of Narayana Guru as a poet.
          Though he was never reputed as a poet, he wrote some of the best hymns
          in the language. The preface to the hymns and instructions regarding
          the selections were given by Dr. Sukumar Azhicode
        </p>

        <li>Contemporary Narayana Guru:</li>
        <p>
          We are products of contemporary times. The events we see are also
          coloured by this subconscious &apos;political&apos; beliefs. This
          section contains such contemporary studies of the Guru. This direct
          transition in time may help to understand history better. This section
          contains six studies.
        </p>

        <li>A Reformer in the Arena of Religion:</li>
        <p>
          This section contains nine articles on what the authors perceived as
          the religious beliefs of Narayana Guru. Whether the Guru was an
          inventor of a new religious philosophy or a religious reformer is an
          open question.
        </p>

        <li>Narayana Guru and Social Transition:</li>
        <p>
          The Narayana Guru we know today primarily is a social reformer. Any
          study that does not touch the social aspect will be unrealistic. This
          section contains six articles that predominantly deal with the social
          angle.
