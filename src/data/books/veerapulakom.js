      <h1>ORU VEERAPULAKATHINTE KATHA</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Veerapulakathinte Katha is a collection of though provoking essays
        written by PK Balakrishnan. The credit for this book goes to Poorna
        Printing & Publishing house, Varkala and Dr S Shaji. Of the compilation
        of 25 articles, 20 are related to history. The evolution of the caste
        sytem in India, the fatal blow the British rule dealt to it and the
        skewed manifestations of the attempts to tilt back the clock come up
        repeatedly in many of these essays. Our failure to appreciate the depths
        to which caste influences our thinking denies the ability to confront
        reality and to come out of its clutches. What started as social reform
        movements is soon overshadowed by regressive counter-movements that seek
        to fight the forces that strike at the roots of the injustices of the
        cast system. It is a tragedy that we are unable to distinguish in our
        freedom struggle these forces from the aspiration and confidence of a
        new thinking striving for self-determination. The articles deal with
        this complex subject in different contexts and levels, Kerala History,
        literature etc. The book consists of the following collection:

  overview:
    "The book deals with the social history of Kerala from the point of evolution of its agricultural villages. It deals separately with the birth of the agrarian economic structure, caste, royalty, ownership, language etc. 1850-1890 is an important period in the social history of Kerala when substantial changes began in the caste society of Kerala. The book ends at the beginning of thisperiod.History was never the same after it was first published in 1983. It was a marked departure from the prevailing history and examined the history afresh on the basis of first hand evidence - the geographic evolution of land area, its resources, accounts of foreign travellers etc. The land and resources and its exploitation hardly supported the glowing past the earlier historians had built.",
