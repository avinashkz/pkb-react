	overview: "The book deals with the social history of Kerala from the point of evolution of its agricultural villages. It deals separately with the birth of the agrarian economic structure, caste, royalty, ownership, language etc. 1850-1890 is an important period in the social history of Kerala when substantial changes began in the caste society of Kerala. The book ends at the beginning of thisperiod.History was never the same after it was first published in 1983. It was a marked departure from the prevailing history and examined the history afresh on the basis of first hand evidence - the geographic evolution of land area, its resources, accounts of foreign travellers etc. The land and resources and its exploitation hardly supported the glowing past the earlier historians had built.",
