			<h1>CHANDUMENON - ORU PADANAM</h1>

			<p>Chandumenon Oru Padanam by Balakrishnan is a study on the first Malayalam novelist Oyyarathu Chandu Menon.  &quot;It was not the greatness of the literary figure of Chandumenon that first attracted me to him. His personality is much bigger than his writings. My contact with his literature is as a tool that reveals his special personality. His personality has many useful facets if understood in the context of the prevailing social milieu. My main attempt in this book is to present that vast personality which I perceived. It means that this book is not strictly a literary criticism. Exclusive essays on literature itself
   are handled through this view point.&quot;</p>

			<p>The preface to this book is written by the author&apos;s friend Prof. M. K. Sanoo.</p>

			<p>The book is dedicated to his teacher Sri.K.J. Alexander.</p>

	overview: "The book deals with the social history of Kerala from the point of evolution of its agricultural villages. It deals separately with the birth of the agrarian economic structure, caste, royalty, ownership, language etc. 1850-1890 is an important period in the social history of Kerala when substantial changes began in the caste society of Kerala. The book ends at the beginning of thisperiod.History was never the same after it was first published in 1983. It was a marked departure from the prevailing history and examined the history afresh on the basis of first hand evidence - the geographic evolution of land area, its resources, accounts of foreign travellers etc. The land and resources and its exploitation hardly supported the glowing past the earlier historians had built.",
